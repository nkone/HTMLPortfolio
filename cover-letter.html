                <p>Dear hiring manager,</p><br>

                <p>
                    &emsp;Throughout my career, I have worked closely with different clients on multiple platforms. My work had helped different teams identify products' defects early, improved overall test coverage on regression models, and maintained industrial standards across various labs.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;For your team, I can bring in my skills in automation scripting with <mark>Python</mark>. My previous projects involved in automating data collection and analysis, networking, and maintaining lab infrastructure.

I worked primarily on <mark>Linux</mark> systems, <mark>Android</mark>, and <mark>iOS</mark> devices. To compliment my work, I used
                    <mark>Microsoft Excel</mark> for test tracking, reporting, and data analysis.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;After having the opportunity to work with multiple leading companies in the consumer products based industry, I understood the importance of reliability, scalability, and user experience in creating a product. I am particularly drawn to your company because of a new opportunity that would further advance my career. With this position, I am excited for a chance to apply my skills and experience for your team.
                </p><br><br>
